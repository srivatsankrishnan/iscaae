Welcome to Acme
---------------

Acme is a library of reinforcement learning (RL) building blocks that strives to
expose simple, efficient, and readable agents. These agents first and foremost
serve both as reference implementations as well as providing strong baselines
for algorithm performance. However, the baseline agents exposed by Acme should
also provide enough flexibility and simplicity that they can be used as a
starting block for novel research. Finally, the building blocks of Acme are
designed in such a way that the agents can be written at multiple scales (e.g.
single-stream vs. distributed agents).
